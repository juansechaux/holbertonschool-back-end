## API

Explore the world of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) in this section. From basic concepts to advanced topics, discover how APIs enable communication between different software systems.

### Example Project: Simple API with Express

In this project, you'll build a simple API using the Express framework for Node.js. Learn how to handle routes, request parameters, and create a basic API structure.

## REST API

Dive into the principles of Representational State Transfer (REST) and learn how to design and implement RESTful APIs. Explore RESTful practices and conventions for creating scalable and interoperable web services.

### Example Project: Building a RESTful Blog API

Create a RESTful API for a basic blogging platform. Implement CRUD operations, handle authentication, and follow RESTful conventions to design a robust web service.

## Microservices

Explore the architecture of Microservices, a design approach where an application is composed of small, independent services. Learn the benefits and challenges of Microservices and how to build scalable and maintainable systems.

### Example Project: Microblogging Platform

Build a microblogging platform using a Microservices architecture. Understand service communication, data consistency, and deployment strategies for a distributed system.
